# README — PTPPF: Create and Test OCR and Forms Processors

This folder contains the code used in the lab **[PTPPF]: Create and Test OCR and Forms Processors**.

## How to Use
1. **Download the folder** or **copy/paste the code** into your **Vertex AI Workbench** notebook.  
2. **Update all required variables** (project ID, bucket name, processor type, file paths, etc.).  
3. **Run the notebook cells sequentially** from top to bottom.  
4. The lab only requires an **80% passing score**, so you do not need to complete every optional step.
