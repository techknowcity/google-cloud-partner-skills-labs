# Google Cloud Partner Skills Labs – Code Repository

This repository contains my personal collection of code samples, practice scripts, configuration files, and notes created while completing **Google Cloud Partner Skills Labs**.  

Its purpose is to serve as a reference for learning and revisiting key concepts across a wide range of Google Cloud technologies, including:


- Compute, Networking, Storage, IAM  
- Cloud Build, Artifact Registry, and CI/CD  
- Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE)  
- Serverless (Cloud Run, Cloud Functions)  
- APIs and integrations  
- Terraform and infrastructure automation  
- Any other hands-on labs included in the partner program
